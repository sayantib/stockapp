For this project we create a Flask app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input from the user and creates a Bokeh plot of the price data for the last month. The user is given four price options, namely, closing price, opening price, highest price, and lowest price. This data is obtained by accessing the Quandle WIKI dataset via API.
